Peersuite is a open source, decentralized, private alternative to apps like discord or slack.
All data is sent only between clients through encrypted WebRTC channels. There is no server.

The tools included are chat with file sending, collaboarative document editing, a kanban board, screen sharing, video calling, audio chat, and a shared whiteboard for drawing ideas.

If this is something you would like to be a part of, please send a PR.
